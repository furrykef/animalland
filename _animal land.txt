There shouldn't be a keypress between the last two "WE WANT PEACE!"s.


The mole ends everything with "jo". Find out what this means, and note it on the wiki.


Make sure our PNG to MSX conversion tool is intelligent about colors. E.g., if red is foreground, it should be foreground throughout the image. Do this by prioritizing colors, so that the higher priority color is considered foreground.


"Dare ni" is sometimes "Whom?" and sometimes "To whom?" in the script. Are we making the distinction correctly?


Game does not work correctly in blueMSX in MSX2 mode. The Japanese version does.


Buggy behavior with C-BIOS MSX2+ JP setting in openMSX. Background color is black in the main game. May be related to the RAM region we're using.


The けいさつ/ALPD graphic begins at $0b8ed ($98ed in memory space). The pattern data begins at $0b8f0 and runs to $0bfd4, exclusive.

The tilemap begins at $0bfd4 and runs to $0c0de, exclusive.


A character holds a sign in Japanese in the ending (しゃくほう　しろ！！, "Let us go!!").


The ending (at least) loads bank 15 ($1e000-1ffff) into $6000. I think there's code there. We may want to consider leaving this bank alone.
(Hmm, is this actually true?)


<furrykef> Mm, what's the best place to get docs on the MSX, again?

Hacking notes
-------------
http://bifi.msxnet.org/msxnet/tech/megaroms.html#ascii8 -- mapper info

Several codes print out multiple characters. The code that does this can possibly be leveraged for our own text compression.

The bank at $6000 seems to always be set to ROM bank 0 ($00000-01fff). We can probably safely swap it out and back in during the text routines.


RAM variables
-------------
<~GuyveR800> furrykef, It's a MSX1 game, so you can use the "RS232" area in the system RAM
<~GuyveR800> it's a few hundred bytes
<~GuyveR800> that RS232 area was repurposed for MSX2, because it remained unused for MSX1
<~GuyveR800> so none of the routines the game uses will make use of it
<furrykef> what region is that? I can't find it in these docs ^^;
<~GuyveR800> FAF5-FB34
<~GuyveR800> hmm not as large as I thought
<~GuyveR800> (those addresses are inclusive)
<furrykef> Ah, thanks
<~GuyveR800> I think FAF5 means all kinds of things for the Kanji mode and stuff which was added in MSX2+ and/or MSX-DOS2
<~GuyveR800> but again, none of that will be used by that MSX1 ROM game
<@BiFi> FAF5-FAF8 are MSX2 addresses
<@BiFi> FAF9-FAFD are kanji basic related and FAFC contain a few MSX2 and MSX2+ related things


Text blocks
-----------
All ranges are inclusive

006A0-00903   -- intro text
02C80-0363B   -- menu commands (miru, toru, shiraberu...; names of objects; etc.)
14000-1F92E   -- main script [no discontinuities at page boundaries] (wow, 46k!)
1FD20-1FDF3   -- end credits (ASCII) [starting offset approximate]
1FDF4-1FFFF   -- garbage (looks like text, but is just repeat of earlier stuff)


Bank identification
-------------------
00000: 41   - page 0
02000: C3   - page 1
04000: 21   - page 2
06000: 3E   - page 3
08000: 6F   - page 4
0A000: 02   - page 5
0C000: 0F   - page 6
0E000: 03   - page 7
10000: 01   - page 8
12000: 00   - page 9
14000: FE   - page A
16000: 76   - page B
18000: 60   - page C
1A000: 0E   - page D
1C000: 7E   - page E
1E000: 7F   - page F

No duplicates. So long as we don't change these, we can identify a bank by its first byte.
