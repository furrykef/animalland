MURDER IN ANIMAL LAND

Buggy behavior with C-BIOS MSX2+ JP setting in openMSX. Background color is black in the main game. May be related to the RAM region we're using.


Not sure that "Start" and "Continue" on the title screen are always aligned the same. It may depend on when exactly you skip ahead to the title screen.

Also looks like "Continue" is one more pixel to the right, at least as of this run.


Check that <contd> blocks always start with cur_x at 0 as expected


The けいさつ/ALPD graphic begins at $0b8ed ($98ed in memory space). The pattern data begins at $0b8f0 and runs to $0bfd4, exclusive.

The tilemap begins at $0bfd4 and runs to $0c0de, exclusive.


A character holds a sign in Japanese in the ending (しゃくほう　しろ！！, "Release him/her!!" -- perhaps translate as "FREE [name]!!").


The ending (at least) loads bank 15 ($1e000-1ffff) into $6000. Not sure why. We may want to consider leaving this bank alone.


<furrykef> Mm, what's the best place to get docs on the MSX, again?

<pause> inserts a pause that's much too long after most periods. We need to add a "short pause" code.


<Torbjorn> / <Oidon>け゛んは゛に　のこされた　かみに"<char>"というもし゛か゛
<Torbjorn> / かかれていたのた゛か゛
<Torbjorn> / なにか　おもいあたる　ふしは、ないか？<key>
<Torbjorn> / <Kokon><char>　・・・　なにかか゛　ヌっと　て゛てきたとか、
<Torbjorn> / なーんちゃって、そんなの　わかりませんよ。<end>
<Torbjorn> Depending what the Nu spells out eventually we might have a different character to work with for this line later maybe
<furrykef> I believe it's Nuki
<furrykef> You can probably guess what species he is
<Torbjorn> tanuki? :;p
<furrykef> ding ding ding ding ding!
<Torbjorn> It just depends what we call him then
<Torbjorn> maybe Rocky like Rocky Racoon from that Beatles song :p
<furrykef> I currently just call him Nuki, and refer to the symbol as an "N"
<furrykef> So it'd go something like, "Do you know anything about this?" "It looks like the letter 'N'... but I don't know anything about it."
<Torbjorn> Yeah that's one way to go
<Torbjorn> it just means cutting out a joke from that spot
<Torbjorn> probably doesn't matter in the long run but I'll see if I come up with anything good for it eventually
<Torbjorn> gotta get to bed now, I'll be back later! ;)
<furrykef> Hmm, is it a pun on the word ぬっと? Sorry, I don't always get these things easily. ^^;;
<Torbjorn> Little late now but yeah, it's a pun on ぬっと
<furrykef> We can make note of it and come back to it later


<Torbjorn> Well in the forest you come across this stone tablet that has writing on it
<Torbjorn> it says た゛こいやのこいわはしんきろうなり on it
<Torbjorn> so nothing can be made of it for now and you move on
<Torbjorn> then you come to a point where your path is blocked by rocks and this dialog happens
<Torbjorn> / <Oidon>なるほと゛・・・。<pause>
<Torbjorn> / だんな、こけしいわの　もし゛の　いみか゛
<Torbjorn> / わかりましたせ゛。<key><Oidon>"た゛こいやのこいわはしんきろうなり。"
<Torbjorn> / このもし゛から　"こ"を　ぬいてよめは゛
<Torbjorn> / いいんて゛す。<key><Oidon>つまり　"た゛いやのいわは　しんきろうなり"。<pause>
<Torbjorn> / とすると　このいわは　すへ゛てしんきろう。<pause>
<Torbjorn> / なせ゛　"こ"を　ぬくかって？<pause><key><Oidon>それは　だんな、<pause>　こけしいわた゛からて゛すよ。
<Torbjorn> / "こけし"・・・"こをけす"　という
<Torbjorn> / ことですぜ。<end>
<Torbjorn> So essentially, the name of the kind of rock the stone tablet is made of is referred to as Kokeshi Iwa
<Torbjorn> Looking on google it seems to be a stone that has a towering appearence to it
<Torbjorn> like a Kokeshi doll
<Torbjorn> but anyways, since the stone is Kokeshi stone(iwa), they take it in a literal sense
<Torbjorn> ko keshi
<Torbjorn> which would be ko wo kesu koto, meaning erase the ko
<furrykef> What an obtuse pun :P
<Torbjorn> so erase the "ko" in that reading on the stone and it makes sense
<Torbjorn> yeah :P
<Torbjorn> but anyways since no literal translation would work something unique has to be made up for the Engish translation
<furrykef> Is it essential to the plot?
<Torbjorn> not really :P
<furrykef> Don't have to lose much sleep over it then :P
<Torbjorn> All it does it tell you that all other rocks are an illusion and makes them move out of your path
<Torbjorn> disappear rather


<Torbjorn> So in the ending Koala is talking and eventually he says this
<Torbjorn> / <Koala>おれは　いまこそ　さけふ゛そ゛!
<Torbjorn> / こ<end>
<Torbjorn> At the こ there it's supposed to be a whole new line with starting with ここ
<Torbjorn> but there rest isn't to be found
<Torbjorn> so I'm wondering if maybe it got lost in the script in pieces or something
<Torbjorn> there's also some more lines in all katakana afterwards that I can't find


Pointers
--------
A routine at 2C3A (4C3A in mem space) handles loading pointers for both menus and script. They're passed in via registers. Trap all calls to it.


Release checklist
-----------------
* All passwords work
* All passwords given in monospace font in game script
* Correct pointers are loaded for each password
* Correct passwords are given at the end of each chapter
* All menu item names correct and sensible in context
* No menu item names overflow
* No "Translation goes here" in script
* All dialogue has speaker tag
* All dialogue has <end> tag
* <contd> tag always appears where needed
* Make sure I've never mixed up Kokon and Konta
* Password text input never overflows on-screen boundary
* No significant @TODO@'s in code or script
* All lines in main script conform to one of these regexes:
    ^$      [blank line]
    ^//     [comment]
    ^<      [dialogue tag]
    <nl>$
    <key>$
    <end>$
* hacking notes.txt is up to date
* readme.txt has proper word wrapping
* readme.txt and README.md are up to date


When done, submit to MSX sites:
* msx.org
* http://www.generation-msx.nl/software/enix/animal-land-murder-case/translations/886/


Also submit the porn magazine easter egg and possibly ending password to tcrf.net


Hacking notes
-------------
#msxdev on irc.rizon.net

http://bifi.msxnet.org/msxnet/tech/megaroms.html#ascii8 -- mapper info

Several codes print out multiple characters. The code that does this can possibly be leveraged for our own text compression.

The bank at $6000 seems to always be set to ROM bank 0 ($00000-01fff). We can probably safely swap it out and back in during the text routines.


RAM variables
-------------
<~GuyveR800> furrykef, It's a MSX1 game, so you can use the "RS232" area in the system RAM
<~GuyveR800> it's a few hundred bytes
<~GuyveR800> that RS232 area was repurposed for MSX2, because it remained unused for MSX1
<~GuyveR800> so none of the routines the game uses will make use of it
<furrykef> what region is that? I can't find it in these docs ^^;
<~GuyveR800> FAF5-FB34
<~GuyveR800> hmm not as large as I thought
<~GuyveR800> (those addresses are inclusive)
<furrykef> Ah, thanks
<~GuyveR800> I think FAF5 means all kinds of things for the Kanji mode and stuff which was added in MSX2+ and/or MSX-DOS2
<~GuyveR800> but again, none of that will be used by that MSX1 ROM game
<@BiFi> FAF5-FAF8 are MSX2 addresses
<@BiFi> FAF9-FAFD are kanji basic related and FAFC contain a few MSX2 and MSX2+ related things


Text blocks
-----------
All ranges are inclusive

006A0-00903   -- intro text
02C80-0363B   -- menu commands (miru, toru, shiraberu...; names of objects; etc.)
14000-1F92E   -- main script [no discontinuities at page boundaries] (wow, 46k!)
1FD20-1FDF3   -- end credits (ASCII) [starting offset approximate]
1FDF4-1FFFF   -- garbage (looks like text, but is just repeat of earlier stuff)


Bank identification
-------------------
00000: 41   - page 0
02000: C3   - page 1
04000: 21   - page 2
06000: 3E   - page 3
08000: 6F   - page 4
0A000: 02   - page 5
0C000: 0F   - page 6
0E000: 03   - page 7
10000: 01   - page 8
12000: 00   - page 9
14000: FE   - page A
16000: 76   - page B
18000: 60   - page C
1A000: 0E   - page D
1C000: 7E   - page E
1E000: 7F   - page F

No duplicates. So long as we don't change these, we can identify a bank by its first byte.
