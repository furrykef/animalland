The font is a 1bpp raw file named vwf.bin. It can be edited in tools such as Tile Layer Pro and Tile Molester. The width of each character is defined in the char_widths table in animalhack.asm.

The "no" symbol (a circle with a slash through it) appears in the font for characters that correspond to control codes; it's useless to put anything there except as an easter egg. (It's possible we didn't find all of 'em, so always check to see if your special character will display.) The character $10 in the charset ($90 in the game script) is also a control code for menus, though it's blank, because it also gets displayed (as a space).

Atlas is used to insert the script.

The game's text formatting routine is pretty smart. It can wrap lines automatically, and it will automatically prompt for a keypress if the text goes on too long. It's even smart enough not to prompt for a keypress in the middle of a sentence, except for a logical pausing point such as a comma. If your text goes on too long with no place where it can pause, the game will print an error message with diagnostic information. You would almost have to be doing it on purpose or writing very badly indeed for this to happen.
