When the walkthrough says "question [name] thoroughly", it means ask all the questions available. Sometimes asking a question reveals a new topic; be sure to ask about it too. Some questions may not be necessary to ask, but it isn't worth the trouble finding out which ones. Also, show them all the items you have.
