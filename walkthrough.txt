This is only the bare minimum needed to get through the game, or close to it, anyway.

A walkthrough in Japanese is here: http://www.d1.dion.ne.jp/~gake/koryaku/animal/animal.htm


Chapter 1
---------
Victim's room:
* Look table (find envelope)
* Take envelope (also reveals scrap of paper with "N")
* Check envelope (find note from Gonkichi to Peruu)
* Check chair (find gun)
* Take gun
* Look floor (allows checking it)
* Check floor (find blond hair)
* Take blond hair

Shop:
* Look shop (find that the jewels are gone)

* Take note
* Check note (learn about Taaji and Rinrin)

Study:
* Open drawer (it's locked, but this is still a necessary step)
* Open bookcase (find safe)
* Check safe (allows trying to open it)

After doing all these, it should be possible to go to HQ.

HQ:
* Check everyone


Chapter 2
---------
When the walkthrough says "question [name] thoroughly", it means ask all the questions available. Sometimes asking a question reveals a new topic; be sure to ask about it too. Some questions may not be necessary to ask, but it isn't worth the trouble finding out which ones.

Pyonko's shop:
* Question Pyonko thoroughly
* Show Pyonko the blond hair, note, and gun

Red's room:
* Check desk (find notepad)
* Take notepad
* Check notepad (reveals Konta had something to do at 8:30 on the 10th)

HQ:
* Info (establishes time of murder)
* Summon Konta
* Question Konta thoroughly
* Show Konta the blond hair, note, and gun
* Show Konta the notepad twice (reveals he met Ling-Ling)
* Ask Konta about Ling-Ling
* Summon Kokon
* Question Kokon thoroughly
* Show Kokon the blond hair, note, and gun

* Question Kokon thoroughly
* Sniff Kokon (identify perfume smell)
* Seek info at HQ (Peruu becomes available)
* Sniff Peruu (identify perfume as the perfume Kokon had on him)
* Question Peruu thoroughly
** Asking about alibi reveals she was on a date
** Showing gun reveals she gave it to Gonkichi
** Showing memo unlocks Taaji and Rinrin
* Ask Kokon about his alibi (says it's personal)
* Ask Peruu about her alibi again (find out her date was with Kokon)
* Question Taaji thoroughly
** Asking about Gonchiki's quarrels unlocks Dragon Cafe

This should take you to the Bear Bar
