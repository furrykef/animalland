Translation notes
-----------------
WARNING: Here be spoilers!

* Many character names were changed. For example, Renard was originally named Gonkichi, and Kit was originally named Kokon. "Gon" and "kon" are fox noises in Japanese, and "ko-" is often a prefix meaning "little" or "offspring". (For example, a "koinu" is a puppy, and the Koopalings in the Mario series are called "Kokuppa".) So we chose "Renard", which is French for "fox", and of course a fox's offspring is called a "kit". We didn't manage to capture the nuance of every name, and a couple of names were pulled out of a hat.

* "Puff-puff" is mentioned a couple of times. This is a running gag in Enix games (particularly Dragon Quest). Google it if you want to know more.

* Some jokes and other ideas didn't translate. One of the most notable is the "N" that is written on the scrap of paper early in the game was originally a katakana "nu". A minor plot point was that this sloppily written character could also be interpreted as a kanji meaning "again" or "later" -- perhaps whoever wrote it intended to return! About the best we could do was suggest it could be a "Z" rather than an "N".

* There is a tortured pun involving a stone you find in the Forest Maze. You are told to find the "Kokeshi Rock". A Japanese player would expect to find a rock in the shape of a Japanese kokeshi doll. Instead, what you actually find is a rock with an inscription that almost makes sense, but not quite. Your partner realizes the inscription makes sense if you remove the letter "ko" -- the word "kokeshi" has a second meaning of "erase the 'ko'".


QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
-------------------
We can't call 'em "frequently asked questions" because then we would be lying.

Q: The game said something about a file to record my progress. Where are the files stored?
A: They aren't. The names are really passwords.

Q: Is there any way to go back to the title screen after choosing "continue"?
A: None that we've found. Reset your MSX.

Q: Can I back out of a command menu when there's no "Cancel" option?
A: Press the 0 key.

Q: This game's too easy!
A: That's not a question. And, well, it is something of a kid's game.

Q: This game's graphics suck!
A: One, that's still not a question. Two, this game was written for the MSX1, on which it is extremely hard to get pretty graphics. The screen is divided into 8x8 tiles, and each line of pixels in those tiles can only have two colors. That means, for example, that drawing an outline around a character or object is just not possible. I'm sure that a particularly skilled artist would be able to create better images, but it would not be easy. Prettier MSX games generally used the much more advanced graphics capabilities of the MSX2.
